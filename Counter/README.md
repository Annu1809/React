<h1>Counter React Project</h1>

  <p>This is a basic React project named "Counter" that demonstrates the usage of the <code>useState</code> concept to manage state in a functional component. The project includes a simple counter with an initial value of 5 and two buttons, "Increase" and "Decrease," to manipulate the counter value.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Initial Value:</strong> The counter is initialized with a default value of 5.</li>
    <li><strong>Increase Button:</strong> Clicking the "Increase" button increments the counter value by 1.</li>
    <li><strong>Decrease Button:</strong> Clicking the "Decrease" button decrements the counter value by 1.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><code>src/App.jsx</code>: Contains the main React component with the counter functionality.</p>
